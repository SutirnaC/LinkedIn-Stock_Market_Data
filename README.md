# LinkedIn-Stock_Market_Data
Acquiring data through Jupyter Notebook and visualization through R

I have saved the Stock Market Data through the ipynb file named "Stock Market Data.ipynb".
I have deleted a few rows of unnecessary data and saved the file in xlsx format instead of csv. The file is names "Stock Market Data.xlsx".
I have uploaded this file into R. I have created a time series plot of the Opening Stock Price vs Date of SBI. The .R code is named "Stock Price GIF.R".
The final GIF is stored as "stock_price_SBI_animation.gif".
